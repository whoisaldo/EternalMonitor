## Unreleased

### What's new
- Selectable capture display: a "Capture display" picker in the Settings tab streams any
  output, including a virtual extended display from a signed Indirect Display Driver — the
  iPad can be a true second screen, not just a mirror. Default stays primary (no change).
- Startup banner and Stream tab now show the active capture source.
- One-step Windows installer (`EternalMonitor-Setup.exe`) that bundles the host, FFmpeg
  runtime, and the virtual display driver — one double-click + one UAC prompt for testers.
- Credits/contact added to the Windows GUI and the iPad app Settings.
